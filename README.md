# SimpleAuthWebPage

This is a Simple Website I created with my Team members for one of my Senior Year classes at Texas Tech University. The Webpage is used for Authorization only for now. We also had hardware component that was looked over by other team members which is yet to be integrated but is not a future possibility due to the end of semester right around the corner.

However, with this web application, one can create an account for other users and people can log into the system using FireBase Authorization System.

The basic idea was for a Smart Trash where there are managers and drivers. So, a manager can create accounts whereas a driver can only sign-in. Eventually, after they log-in, it takes them to a portal from where eiter the manager or the driver can view and collect dumpsters that are full.

Thanks for being here.
